# Integrated Job Post Verification and Personalized Job Recommendation System

## Abstract

In today's dynamic job market, ensuring the accuracy of job postings and providing personalized job recommendations are crucial. This project addresses these challenges by combining Job Posting Verification and a Personalized Job Recommendation System. Leveraging advanced data mining techniques and a comprehensive dataset, our system enhances the reliability of job listings and helps users find the most suitable opportunities.

## Introduction

Recognizing the need for a reliable solution, this project introduces a unique approach that integrates Job Posting Verification and a Personalized Job Recommendation System. Job Posting Verification safeguards job seekers by meticulously checking the authenticity of job listings, including details like salary ranges, company profiles, and benefits. This verification process establishes trust and transparency in the job market, shielding users from false information.

The Personalized Job Recommendation System focuses on connecting job seekers with opportunities that align with their skills, preferences, and geographic interests. By analyzing individual skills and preferences against job attributes, the system ensures highly compatible and relevant job suggestions. It takes into account factors such as job titles, locations, and detailed job descriptions, enhancing the overall suitability of recommendations.

## Methods

In this project, we employed advanced data mining techniques to address job market challenges. The following methods were implemented:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - A comprehensive dataset of job postings was gathered from Kaggle, containing detailed information such as job titles, locations, department, salary ranges, company profiles, and benefits.
   - Link to the dataset [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning was performed, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in job postings data.
   - Textual data underwent preprocessing using techniques like tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.
   - Relevant features were extracted from job postings, such as description, company profile, requirements, and salary.

3. **Job Posting Verification:**
   - Utilized advanced data mining techniques, including named entity recognition and text pattern matching, to validate job postings' authenticity.
   - Conducted Data Quality Assessment to ensure completeness, accuracy, and reliability of information.

4. **Personalized Job Recommendation System:**
   - Utilized NLP techniques for understanding user intent from search queries, extracting key elements using tokenization, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
   - Implemented Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering for recommending closely aligned jobs based on user skills and preferences.

5. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Trained classification models to identify fraudulent job postings based on verified data points.
   - Implemented classification models to understand user intent from search queries, classifying queries into categories for precise recommendations.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Developed metrics to measure the accuracy of job posting verification.
   - Utilized precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the personalized job recommendation system.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Detailed documentation and reports were prepared for all methods, algorithms, data preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics.

By following these methods, we created a robust Integrated Job Post Verification and Personalized Job Recommendation System, ensuring the authenticity of job postings while providing tailored job recommendations based on users' personalized search queries.
